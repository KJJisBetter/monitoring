# Performance Monitoring Tool

## Project To-Do List

### 1. Project Planning and Setup
- **Define Requirements:**
  - List the system metrics you want to monitor (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network activity).
  - Define the frequency of data collection.
  - Determine the architecture and components of the tool.
- **Set Up Development Environment:**
  - Install necessary tools and libraries for C, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
  - Set up version control using Git.

### 2. Backend Development in C
- **Data Collection Module:**
  - Implement functions to collect CPU usage.
  - Implement functions to collect memory usage.
  - Implement functions to collect disk I/O statistics.
  - Implement functions to collect network activity.
- **Data Aggregation and Storage:**
  - Design a data structure to store collected metrics.
  - Implement data aggregation logic.
  - Ensure efficient memory usage and performance.

### 3. API Development with Flask
- **Set Up Flask Project:**
  - Create a new Flask project.
  - Set up the project structure (e.g., separate directories for templates, static files, and routes).
- **Create RESTful API Endpoints:**
  - Endpoint to retrieve CPU usage data.
  - Endpoint to retrieve memory usage data.
  - Endpoint to retrieve disk I/O data.
  - Endpoint to retrieve network activity data.
- **Integrate C Backend:**
  - Use Python’s `ctypes` or `cffi` library to call C functions from Flask.
  - Ensure seamless data transfer between C backend and Flask API.

### 4. Frontend Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
- **Design the Dashboard Layout:**
  - Use HTML and Bootstrap to create a responsive layout.
  - Design sections for different metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).
- **Implement Real-time Data Visualization:**
  - Use JavaScript and a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to visualize data.
  - Fetch data from Flask API using AJAX or Fetch API.
  - Update charts in real-time.
- **Style the Dashboard:**
  - Use CSS and Bootstrap to ensure a clean and modern design.
  - Ensure the dashboard is responsive and works on different devices.

### 5. Testing and Optimization
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for C functions.
  - Write unit tests for Flask API endpoints.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the integration between C backend and Flask API.
  - Test the frontend’s interaction with the Flask API.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize C code for efficient data collection.
  - Ensure Flask API responds quickly to data requests.
  - Optimize frontend to handle real-time updates smoothly.

### 6. Deployment
- **Prepare for Deployment:**
  - Create a production-ready build of your frontend.
  - Set up a production server for Flask.
  - Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured.
- **Deploy the Application:**
  - Deploy the Flask API on a server (e.g., using Gunicorn and Nginx).
  - Serve the frontend files using a web server.
- **Monitor and Maintain:**
  - Set up logging and monitoring for your application.
  - Regularly update and maintain the application.

### 7. Documentation and Presentation
- **Document Your Code:**
  - Write clear and concise comments in your C, Python, and JavaScript code.
  - Create a README file with setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- **Prepare a Presentation:**
  - Create slides to explain the project’s goals, architecture, and features.
  - Include screenshots or a live demo of the performance monitoring tool.
  - Practice presenting your project to an audience.
