# Monitoring but in C ðŸ—¿
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
## Features

- **CPU Usage Monitoring**
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**
- **Disk I/O Monitoring**
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**

I did this becuase I have a homelab and always wanted to make my own monitor even though I already have one.
But then I just thought what if I do a monitor but using C as the backend. Would maybe been easier using python? Yes.
But I did it on C ðŸ—¿, and also C is probably the most interesting language and this helped me learn way more about pointers.
